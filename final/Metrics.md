## Non-functional requirements
### Efficiency
Page loading time: < 2 seconds
Delivery of search results: < 1 second
API response time: < 500ms for 95% of requests
Optimize images for fast loading
Booking confirmation: < 3 seconds
### Availability
System uptime: 99.9% (excluding maintenance)
Scheduled maintenance during off-peak hours (from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m.)
Maximum of 30 minutes of unplanned downtime per month
Reduced performance mode during peak loads
### Scalability
Support for more than 10,000 simultaneous users
Horizontal scaling for all services without saving state
Database replicas for operations with a large number of queries
Automatic scaling depending on the type of traffic
Seasonal peak load support (3 times higher than normal load)
### Safety
HTTPS for all communications
JWT with a short validity period for authentication
Compliance with payment processing requirements
Data encryption during storage and transmission
Compliance with regional data protection requirements
Preventing password selection with account lock
Regular security checks and penetration testing
### Reliability
Database replication with automatic switching in case of failure
Data backup every 6 hours in S3
Deploy to multiple availability zones for mission-critical services
Message Queue (Kafka) for asynchronous operations
Retry mechanisms for mission-critical operations
### Data management
Main PostgreSQL server with read replicas
Redis cache for frequently used data
Media files are stored in S3 with CDN delivery
Data storage policies in accordance with regulatory requirements
Regular database maintenance and optimization

## Business metrics
### User engagement
Monthly Active Users (MAU): target is 250,000+
Average session duration: the goal is 15+ minutes
### Quality indicators
Average score of the tour: 4.5+ out of 5 goal
Customer satisfaction level: target 85%+
Share of reviews: target 30% of completed bookings

## The CAP theorem
### System Characteristics
The system is focused on AP (availability and fault tolerance)
In offline scenarios (mobile app), we temporarily sacrifice consistency.
Consistency is achieved after synchronization via Kafka events
Tour availability uses a conditional consistency model with short caching time


### Implementation Details
Redis cache for tour availability with 5-minute caching time
Kafka provides conditional consistency between microservices
Optimistic concurrency control for booking operations
The idempotent API architecture prevents duplicate orders
Local storage in mobile apps with background synchronization
Transaction isolation levels in the database, configurable depending on the criticality of the operation
Data Replication strategy
The main PostgreSQL database with multiple replicas for reading
Read operations are distributed between replicas
Synchronization of the Redis cache between regions
The consistency of the data is verified through scheduled data reconciliation tasks.
